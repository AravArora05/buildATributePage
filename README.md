Project: Build A Tribue for a person/place/thing

Description: Part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum, this project involves creating a tribute form using HTML/CSS

Features: 
  
  CSS Styling:
  - Employs team colors for a stylish presentation and visually distinct sections.
  - Uses CSS for layout and responsive features
  - Includes anchor links for easy navigation to specific page sections,
  - Features links to external profiles and more detailed information about players and coaches.
  - Utilizes a fixed header that remains visible at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls up and down the page.

*Beware: this website works well on computers, but doesn't look incredible on phones!(yet as of May 3rd)

Remarks: Since we haven't really dwelved into media queries, the project looks mediocre on smaller devices! I need to work better to improve upon responsive web design. In future projects, I will try to figure out how to make HTML/CSS code more responsive! 
In later May, I will likely come back to this project, and I will attempt to add responsiveness for all devices!
