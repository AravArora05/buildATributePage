Project: Build A Tribue for a person/place/thing

Description: Part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum, this project involves creating a tribute form using HTML/CSS

Features: For this one, I really wanted to experiment with different HTML/CSS concepts that we've learned in previous projects. For example, I wanted to apply having a fixed header. Furthermore, I wanted to have a stylish presentation with the spsecial GT colors! This is why I ended up using a linear gradient! Lastly, I wanted to include interactive media! As a result, anchor links can take you to pictures/website links of each of the prominent players!

*Beware: this website works well on computers, but doesn't look incredible on phones!
Remarks: Since we haven't really dwelved into media queries, the thing looks absoultely horrible on devices such as my iphone! I need to work better to improve upon responsive web design. In future projects, I will try to figure out how to make the assignment a bit more responsive! I will be starting the second half of the course on Monday, which is more focused on making the websites responsive for all devices!
