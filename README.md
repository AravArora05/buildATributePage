Project: Build A Tribue for a person/place/thing

Description: Part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification curriculum, this project involves creating a tribute form using HTML/CSS

Features: 
  
  CSS Styling:
  - Employs team colors for a stylish presentation and visually distinct sections., Uses CSS for layout and responsive features, features anchor links for easy navigation to specific page sections, features links to external profiles and more detailed information about players and coaches.

*Beware: this website works well on computers, but doesn't look incredible on phones!

Remarks: Since we haven't really dwelved into media queries, the thing looks absoultely horrible on devices such as my iphone! I need to work better to improve upon responsive web design. In future projects, I will try to figure out how to make the assignment a bit more responsive! I will be starting the second half of the course on Monday, which is more focused on making the websites responsive for all devices!
